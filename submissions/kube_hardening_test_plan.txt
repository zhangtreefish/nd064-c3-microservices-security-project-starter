How will you test the changes? 
The changes will be tested locally first in dev, using Rancher, kube-bench;
Then the changes will be deployed to dev, staging and finally as canary in production environment to ensure no regression (of normal functionalities)  takes place.  
All environments are run in CI/CD pipelines, with unit, integration, and performance and security testing all hooked in place to alert any breach of SLOs. 

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
With the above plan of testing in different stages, and with all deployments and daemonsets set up for monitoring, logging and alerting using Prometheus and Grafana,
the risks of negative impact can be reduced, and triaged via Commander to handle incidents.
Having a zero-trust and blame-free mindset and culture will drive people to automate more.
